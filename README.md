# AlignGPT
“This project implements a mini LLM alignment pipeline using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). It includes training a reward model from human-annotated preference data, fine-tuning the language model via policy optimization, and performing ablation studies to evaluate robustness, fairness, and alignment trade-offs.”
