# Reward Model Documentation for RLHF-Lab (Comprehensive Extended Version)

The Reward Model (RM) is a cornerstone of the RLHF-Lab framework, tasked with evaluating and scoring candidate responses from a policy model to guide reinforcement learning. Its primary role is to align language model outputs with human preferences by providing reliable scalar reward signals. This documentation provides an exhaustive overview of the Reward Model, covering architecture, training, evaluation, integration, scalability, safety, and best practices, aimed at market-level implementations and real-world applications.

## 1. Objective and Role of the Reward Model

The RM is designed to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Human Preference Alignment**: Score responses according to human-labeled preference data, ensuring outputs are helpful, relevant, and safe.
2. **Training Guidance**: Serve as a quantitative signal for reinforcement learning updates in PPO or DPO, shaping the policy model toward preferred behavior.
3. **Quality and Safety Control**: Detect incoherent, low-quality, or potentially harmful responses.
4. **Scalable Evaluation**: Efficiently process large batches of generated outputs during RLHF training.
5. **Benchmarking and Research**: Facilitate comparisons across model iterations, training strategies, and different RLHF techniques.

Without a robust RM, the RLHF process cannot effectively improve alignment or output quality.

## 2. Input and Output Specifications

### 2.1 Inputs

* **Hidden Representations**: Typically derived from the last transformer layer of the policy model.
* **Tokenized Sequences**: Inputs must use the same tokenizer as the policy model to maintain embedding consistency.
* **Prompt Context**: Optionally, the RM can consider both the prompt and the generated response to evaluate contextual relevance.

### 2.2 Outputs

* **Scalar Reward**: A single floating-point number indicating response quality.
* **Pairwise Comparison Output**: Indicates preference between two candidate responses.

Example usage:

```python
reward_score = rm_model(hidden_states)  # Returns scalar
```

## 3. Reward Model Architecture

### 3.1 Base Transformer Backbone

* Typically initialized from the same architecture as the policy model (e.g., GPT-2/3).
* Embedding spaces are aligned with the policy model to ensure meaningful reward predictions.
* Optional freezing of lower layers can reduce computation and prevent overfitting.

### 3.2 Reward Head

* Linear layer projecting token embeddings to a scalar score.
* Advanced implementations may use MLP layers, attention-based pooling, or sequence-level aggregation.

```python
self.reward_head = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
```

### 3.3 Pooling Strategies

* **Mean Pooling**: Average across all token embeddings.
* **Attention Pooling**: Learnable attention weights to emphasize important tokens.
* **CLS Token**: Use special classification token for output.

### 3.4 Loss Functions

* **Pairwise Logistic Loss**: Optimizes preference ordering between chosen and rejected responses.
* **Margin Ranking Loss**: Ensures a minimum reward gap between preferred and non-preferred outputs.
* **MSE or Soft Cross-Entropy**: When converting preferences to probabilistic reward targets.

Example pairwise loss computation:

```python
loss = -torch.log(torch.sigmoid(R(chosen) - R(rejected)))
```

## 4. Training Procedure

### 4.1 Data Preparation

* Dataset: Preference pairs `{prompt, chosen, rejected}`.
* Tokenize consistently with policy model.
* Optionally augment with synthetic or semi-supervised preference data.
* Split into training, validation, and test sets for monitoring generalization.

### 4.2 Model Initialization

* Load pretrained transformer backbone.
* Optionally freeze early layers.
* Attach reward head for scalar output.

### 4.3 Training Loop

1. Batch preference pairs.
2. Forward pass through transformer to get embeddings.
3. Compute reward for chosen and rejected responses.
4. Calculate pairwise loss.
5. Backpropagate and update weights using AdamW.
6. Validate on held-out preference pairs periodically.

### 4.4 Optimization and Stability

* **Gradient Clipping**: Prevent exploding gradients.
* **Mixed Precision Training**: FP16 for memory efficiency.
* **Learning Rate Schedules**: Warmup followed by decay.
* **Early Stopping**: Based on validation pairwise accuracy.

## 5. Evaluation

### 5.1 Automatic Metrics

* **Pairwise Accuracy**: Fraction of preference pairs correctly ranked.
* **Correlation with Human Judgments**: Spearman or Pearson correlation.
* **Reward Distribution Analysis**: Identify skew, bias, or reward hacking.

### 5.2 Human-in-the-Loop Validation

* Human reviewers assess model rankings to ensure alignment with true preferences.
* Useful for detecting subtle misalignments or unsafe outputs.

### 5.3 Cross-Domain Benchmarking

* Evaluate RM across multiple tasks and datasets.
* Compare against previous RM versions or baseline scoring models.

2. Score candidates using the RM.
3. Feed scalar rewards into PPO or DPO for policy updates.
4. Maintain RM checkpointing for reproducibility.
5. Ensure consistent tokenization and embedding alignment with the policy model.
