# 📓 RLHF Notebook
This notebook demonstrates a minimal RLHF loop using a small LLM (like GPT-2) and simulated preference data, guiding you through loading, fine-tuning, reward modeling, and policy optimization. It is designed to tell the story of RLHF in an educational yet practical way, highlighting key steps, explanations, and real-world considerations.

## 1. Introduction & Setup

**Markdown Explanation:**

> This notebook demonstrates a minimal RLHF loop with fake preference data. We simulate human preferences to teach a small LLM how to align with human-like responses.

**Python Setup:**

```python
import torch
import random
import numpy as np
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Set random seeds for reproducibility
random.seed(42)
numpy.random.seed(42)
torch.manual_seed(42)
```

* **Why:** Ensures consistent results every time you run the notebook.
* **Libraries:** `torch` for modeling, `transformers` for pretrained LLMs, `numpy` and `random` for consistent data handling.

---

## 2. Load Base Model

**Markdown Explanation:**

> We load a small pretrained model (GPT-2) as our starting point. It knows language but doesn’t know human preferences yet.

**Python Code:**

```python
tok = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
policy = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
```

* **Why:** The base LLM is our “student” that will be gradually taught to align with human preferences.
* **Tip:** For real experiments, consider LLaMA, Falcon, or other larger models for better performance.

## 3. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

**Markdown Explanation:**

> We warm-start the model with examples of helpful answers. This step ensures the LLM has a foundation of high-quality responses before RLHF.

**Python Outline:**

```python
# Example: fine-tune on a tiny dataset
sft_dataset = [{"prompt": "What is AI?", "response": "AI stands for Artificial Intelligence and it simulates human intelligence."}]
# Define DataLoader, optimizer, and train loop here
```

* **Why:** SFT provides an initial bias towards human-like, safe, and coherent answers.
* **Tip:** In real projects, use large human-written datasets like StackExchange, Wikipedia Q&A, or curated help documents.

---

## 4. Generate Candidate Answers

**Markdown Explanation:**

> We generate multiple answers for the same prompt. These will later be scored by humans or the reward model.

**Python Example:**

```python
prompt = "Explain quantum computing in simple terms."
inputs = tok(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = [policy.generate(**inputs, max_length=50) for _ in range(3)]
candidate_answers = [tok.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True) for out in outputs]
print(candidate_answers)
```

* **Why:** Generating multiple responses allows comparison, ranking, and preference modeling.
* **Tip:** Use temperature and top-k/top-p sampling to produce diverse outputs.

---

## 5. Preference Data

**Markdown Explanation:**

> In real life, humans provide this data by choosing the best answer. Here we simulate it with a tiny dataset.

**Python Example:**

```python
prefs = [
    {"prompt": "What is quantum computing?",
     "chosen": "Quantum computing uses qubits and superposition.",
     "rejected": "Quantum computing is magic."}
]
```

* **Why:** Preference pairs are the foundation of the reward model training.
* **Tip:** Collect a diverse set covering multiple domains to ensure broad LLM alignment.

---

## 6. Reward Model Training

**Markdown Explanation:**

> The reward model learns to score answers like a human would. It predicts which answer in a pair is better.

**Python Outline:**

```python
import torch.nn as nn
class RewardModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size=768):
        super().__init__()
        self.head = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
    def forward(self, hidden_states):
        return self.head(hidden_states.mean(dim=1))

# Train on preference pairs using pairwise loss
```

* **Why:** Automates preference scoring so you don’t need humans for every iteration.
* **Tip:** Use margin ranking loss or logistic pairwise loss to train effectively.

---

## 7. RL Optimization (PPO or DPO)

**Markdown Explanation:**

> Now we update the policy so it generates more preferred answers using reinforcement learning.

**Python Outline:**

```python
# PPO/DPO update pseudocode
for batch in generated_batches:
    rewards = reward_model(batch)
    # PPO: compute advantage, update policy with clipped objective
    # DPO: maximize probability of preferred responses
```

* **Why:** This is the core RLHF step — aligning the LLM to human preferences.
* **Tip:** Start small with toy examples, then scale to larger datasets and models.

---

## 8. Evaluation

**Markdown Explanation:**

> Compare model outputs before and after RLHF. Observe how the LLM shifts toward human-aligned behavior.

**Python Example:**

```python
pre_train_output = policy.generate(**inputs, max_length=50)
# After RLHF training
post_train_output = policy.generate(**inputs, max_length=50)
print("Before:", tok.decode(pre_train_output[0]))
print("After:", tok.decode(post_train_output[0]))
```

* **Why:** Evaluation ensures the RLHF loop is producing meaningful improvement.
* **Tip:** Use both automated metrics (reward model scores, BLEU, ROUGE) and human evaluation.

## 9. Conclusion & Next Steps

* Summarize the notebook achievements:

  * Loaded a base LLM.
  * Fine-tuned with supervised data.
  * Generated candidates and created preference pairs.
  * Trained a reward model.
  * Optimized the policy with PPO/DPO.
  * Evaluated improvements.

* **Next Steps:**

  * Scale up using larger datasets and real human feedback.
  * Improve reward model with more sophisticated architectures.
  * Monitor for safety, bias, and reward hacking.
  * Deploy on GPUs/TPUs and optimize for batch processing.

**Summary Analogy:**
Think of this notebook as teaching a student:

1. Show good examples (SFT).
2. Generate work to evaluate (candidate answers).
3. Score them like a teacher (reward model).
4. Guide the student to do better (PPO/DPO).
5. Repeat until mastery (evaluation).

The story of RLHF is about **iterative, preference-based learning** — a journey from a general LLM to a human-aligned AI.
