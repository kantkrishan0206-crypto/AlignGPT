# 📓 RLHF Notebook Story — Step-by-Step Extended Guide (1000+ Words)

This notebook illustrates a minimal RLHF loop using a small LLM (like GPT-2) and simulated preference data. It narrates the journey of an LLM from a base language model to a human-aligned AI, covering loading, supervised fine-tuning, candidate generation, reward modeling, reinforcement learning (PPO/DPO), and evaluation. Each section includes explanations, code examples, and practical insights, making it suitable for educational and prototyping purposes.

## 1. Introduction & Setup

**Markdown Explanation:**

> This notebook demonstrates a full RLHF loop using a toy LLM and simulated preferences. We aim to teach the model to generate human-preferred responses in a stepwise, reproducible manner.

**Python Setup:**

```python
import torch
import random
import numpy as np
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Set random seeds for reproducibility
random.seed(42)
numpy.random.seed(42)
torch.manual_seed(42)
```

* **Purpose:** Ensures deterministic results.
* **Libraries:** `torch` for neural network training, `transformers` for pretrained models, `numpy` and `random` for consistent data handling.
* **Tip:** Adjust seeds when experimenting with multiple runs.

---

## 2. Load Base Model

**Markdown Explanation:**

> Load a small pretrained LLM (GPT-2) as the starting point. It understands language but not human preferences yet.

**Python Code:**

```python
tok = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
policy = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
```

* **Rationale:** The base LLM is our “student,” ready to learn alignment through supervised fine-tuning and RL.
* **Tip:** For real projects, consider larger models (e.g., LLaMA, Falcon) for better generalization.

---

## 3. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

**Markdown Explanation:**

> Warm-start the model with high-quality question-answer pairs to bias it toward helpful responses.

**Python Outline:**

```python
sft_dataset = [{"prompt": "What is AI?", "response": "AI simulates human intelligence through algorithms."}]
# Implement DataLoader, optimizer, and train loop here
```

* **Purpose:** SFT builds a foundation of safe and coherent responses before RLHF.
* **Best Practice:** Use extensive datasets for meaningful performance gains.

---

## 4. Generate Candidate Answers

**Markdown Explanation:**

> Generate multiple answers for the same prompt to enable preference comparisons.

**Python Example:**

```python
prompt = "Explain quantum computing in simple terms."
inputs = tok(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = [policy.generate(**inputs, max_length=50) for _ in range(3)]
candidate_answers = [tok.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True) for out in outputs]
print(candidate_answers)
```

* **Why:** Multiple responses allow the system to learn which outputs are preferred.
* **Tip:** Use stochastic sampling for diversity (temperature, top-k, top-p).

---

## 5. Preference Data

**Markdown Explanation:**

> In practice, humans provide preference data. Here we simulate it for demonstration.

**Python Example:**

```python
prefs = [
    {"prompt": "What is quantum computing?",
     "chosen": "Quantum computing uses qubits and superposition.",
     "rejected": "Quantum computing is magic."}
]
```

* **Purpose:** Preference pairs are the foundation for training the reward model.
* **Tip:** Curate a diverse dataset to cover multiple domains.

## 6. Reward Model Training

**Markdown Explanation:**

> Train a small neural head to predict which answer is preferred. It automates scoring like a human teacher.

**Python Outline:**

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class RewardModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size=768):
        super().__init__()
        self.head = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
    def forward(self, hidden_states):
        return self.head(hidden_states.mean(dim=1))

# Train on preference pairs using pairwise loss (margin ranking or logistic)
```

* **Rationale:** Reduces human annotation workload and provides scalar rewards for RL training.
* **Tip:** Regularly validate the reward model to avoid misalignment.

---

## 7. RL Optimization (PPO or DPO)

**Markdown Explanation:**

> Update the policy to generate more preferred responses using RL techniques.

**Python Outline:**

```python
# Pseudocode for PPO/DPO step
for batch in generated_batches:
    rewards = reward_model(batch)
    # PPO: compute advantage, apply clipped surrogate objective
    # DPO: maximize likelihood of preferred responses
```

* **Purpose:** Aligns the model outputs with human-like preferences.
* **Tip:** Start with toy datasets; scale gradually for stability.
* **Best Practice:** Clip updates, normalize rewards, and track entropy to prevent divergence.

---

## 8. Evaluation

**Markdown Explanation:**

> Compare outputs before and after RLHF to measure improvements in human alignment.

**Python Example:**

```python
pre_train_output = policy.generate(**inputs, max_length=50)
post_train_output = policy.generate(**inputs, max_length=50)
print("Before:", tok.decode(pre_train_output[0]))
print("After:", tok.decode(post_train_output[0]))
```

* **Metrics:** Pairwise accuracy, RM reward, BLEU/ROUGE, semantic similarity.
* **Tip:** Include human evaluation for qualitative assessment.

## 9. Conclusion & Next Steps

* Achievements:

  1. Loaded base LLM.
  2. Fine-tuned with supervised data.
  3. Generated candidate responses.
  4. Created preference pairs.
  5. Trained reward model.
  6. Optimized policy with PPO/DPO.
  7. Evaluated improvements.

* **Next Steps:**

  * Scale to larger datasets and real human feedback.
  * Improve reward model with deeper architectures.
  * Ensure safety, fairness, and robustness.
  * Deploy on GPUs/TPUs and optimize for batch training.

**Analogy:**
Teaching a student:

1. Show good examples (SFT).
2. Generate work to evaluate (candidate answers).
3. Score them like a teacher (reward model).
4. Guide improvement (PPO/DPO).
5. Repeat until mastery (evaluation).

**Key Insight:** RLHF is iterative preference-based learning, transforming a generic LLM into a human-aligned AI capable of understanding and following nuanced preferences.
